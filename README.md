# B. Tech Final Year Project

    Convert your QCFI CCTV footage to CIF Footage using Deep Learning on YUV420 footage.
    Weights trained in Python and saved as ".txt" and used in C. 
    Let's wait and see the results!

## How to build this project

There are a few things you need to build this project. 
    1. pip (Python Package Manager)
    2. gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
    3. Windows (I have made this project on Windows. Not tested on Linux/Mac. I think it can run swiftly.)

Once you are ready with the installations. 

```
git clone git@github.com:ayushmankumar7/final_year_project.git
cd final_year_project
scons
```

You will find a output.exe in `bin` folder.
